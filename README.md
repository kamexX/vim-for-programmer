# Explanation
This Repository holds my settings vimrc from a programmer perspective. It contains a snytax highlighting etc. and a nice looking dracula theme you can easy install using the bash script.

Just give it a try and let your thoughts be in the commentary section.

# Install
``` bash
git clone https://github.com/kamexX/vim-for-programmer
